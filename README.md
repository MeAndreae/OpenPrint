# OpenPrint
A project for an open source ink printing machine.

The aim of this project is to provide a new way of printing that free us from corporations leading the world of print today. The apparition of 3D printing made a lot of noise, because printing in three dimensions is cool and because it was born in the open source community. But the fact is that, nowadays, we print tonnes of paper every single day. Maybe the use of paper is decreasing as fast as the use of screens is increasing, but paper is going to stay. People likes paper, drawing, writing or reading on it. So… why don't we have any open source 2D printer ?

When you think about freeing print making, it opens many doors. The substrate of printing doesn't have to be A4 or A3 or even to be paper. We want to print on papers, woods, glasses, metals of any kind of scale. Why does the substrate need to be standardized ? Because it has to go through the printer. And if it was the printer that has to go on the substrate ?

That's why our OpenPrint machine will be mounted on WHEELS.

The code that will run the OpenPrint will mainly be based on 3D CNC printer code:

— X axis will make the printer rolling, step by step.
— Y axis will move the spraying nozzle (printing head) to let it print line by line.
— Z axis is a kind of bonus. It would change the height of the nozzle, to vary the width of printed dots, according to the grayscale of the picture.
